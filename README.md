# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine learning
Download complete folder and run window.py

## Details: <br>
In this project, we have used a dataset from UCI repository and compared it with multiple machine learning algorithms like KNN, SVM, etc and came up with the conclusion that KNN works best for this dataset.<br>
After this, I have incorporated this machine learning software with frontend using PyQt and backend using SQLite.<br>
To run this software with frontend and backend both in sync together, download complete folder and run window.py
